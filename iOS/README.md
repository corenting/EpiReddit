# Dev setup

- Install CocoaPods (slow !) with `sudo gem install cocoapods`.
- Install the pods with `pod install`.
- Open the project with the ***.xcworkspace*** file only
- Change the `baseUrl` constant in the Constants file with the base URL of the API backend.***Don't forget the trailing slash***
